# ReST Data Augmentation Service

## Overview
The ReST (Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) for Language Modeling) Data Augmentation Service is a Flask-based application designed to augment and enhance machine translation datasets through a sophisticated data processing and translation improvement cycle. It integrates deep learning models and COMET for translation quality assessment.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Flask
- tqdm
- numpy

Please ensure all dependencies are installed using:
```
pip install torch transformers flask tqdm numpy
```

## Usage
The service can be started with the Flask application and is accessible through a REST API endpoint for processing translation data.

### Starting the Server
Run the server using:
```
python ReST.py
```
This command starts a Flask server running in debug mode on the default port (5000).

### API Endpoint
Once the server is running, you can use the `/process` endpoint to process translation data.

#### POST `/process`
This endpoint processes the input dataset for translation enhancement.

##### Request Format
```json
{
  "input_path": "path/to/input/dataset/",
  "output_path": "path/to/output/dataset/",
  "prompt": "Translate German to English: "
}
```

##### Response Format
```json
{
  "message": "Data processed successfully",
  "output_path": "path/to/output/dataset/"
}
```

### Client Example
A Python client example is provided to demonstrate how to interact with the server:
```python
import requests

url = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/process'
data = {
    'input_path': '/path/to/data/input/',
    'output_path': '/path/to/data/output/',
    'prompt': "Translate German to English: "
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print('Status Code:', response.status_code)
print('Response JSON:', response.json())
```
